# QA_ManualAssignment_5_JMETER

As part of my QA internship at 10Pearls, I completed a JMeter assignment where I created a detailed Test Plan involving all major HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). 
I added Thread Groups, configured Samplers, and included at least two Listeners for each API request. I performed a full CRUD operation: created data using a POST request, retrieved
it with GET, updated a field using PATCH, and deleted it using DELETE. I then verified data deletion by sending a GET request for the same ID and ensuring the response was null/empty.
I also integrated CSV data by reading inputs from a file, sending POST requests, and validating the returned data using GET to confirm accuracy. 
The entire project, including JMeter files and resources, was shared in a public GitHub repository as part of the submission.
